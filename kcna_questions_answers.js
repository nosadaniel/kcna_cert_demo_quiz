      "No, GitOps is strictly limited to managing Kubernetes API objects.",
      "Yes, potentially, if using tools like Crossplane or Terraform controllers that extend the GitOps model to manage external resources.",
      "Only if the external resources are manually synchronized with Git state.",
      "No, managing external resources always requires a separate imperative process.",
      "Yes, by storing credentials for cloud providers directly in Git manifests."
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "correctLetter": "B",
    "explanation": "While core GitOps tools focus on Kubernetes, the principles can be extended. Tools like Crossplane allow defining external cloud resources using Kubernetes custom resources (CRDs). A GitOps operator can then manage these CRDs, effectively extending the GitOps workflow to provision and manage external resources declaratively."

    "options": [
      "Rollbacks require complex manual intervention on the cluster.",
      "Failures are ignored until the next successful Git commit.",
      "Rollbacks are typically achieved by reverting the change in Git and letting the operator synchronize the cluster to the previous known good state.",

    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "correctLetter": "C",
    "explanation": "Because the desired state is versioned in Git, rolling back is often as simple as git revert <commit-hash>. The GitOps operator detects this change in the desired state (now pointing to the older configuration) and automatically rolls the cluster back accordingly."

    "explanation": "CI and GitOps are complementary. The CI pipeline typically handles building the application, running tests, and producing artifacts like container images (often pushing them to a registry).

    "correct": 1,
    "correctLetter": "B",
    "explanation": "Baking configuration into images requires rebuilding the image for every configuration change (e.g., database URL).

    "explanation": "Helm charts provide a way to package and template Kubernetes applications. In a GitOps context, the desired state in Git might be defined using Helm charts and value files.
