329,"Can GitOps manage resources outside of Kubernetes (e.g., cloud databases, DNS records)?","No, GitOps is strictly limited to managing Kubernetes API objects.","Yes, potentially, if using tools like Crossplane or Terraform controllers that extend the GitOps model to manage external resources.",Only if the external resources are manually synchronized with Git state.,"No, managing external resources always requires a separate imperative process.","Yes, by storing credentials for cloud providers directly in Git manifests.",B,"While core GitOps tools focus on Kubernetes, the principles can be extended. Tools like Crossplane allow defining external cloud resources using Kubernetes custom resources (CRDs). A GitOps operator can then manage these CRDs, effectively extending the GitOps workflow to provision and manage external resources declaratively.",Cloud Native Application Delivery,GitOps
330,"What is the purpose of a ""smoke test"" in a CD pipeline, often run immediately after deployment?",To perform comprehensive end-to-end functional testing of all features.,To check the basic health and availability of the newly deployed application or service.,To run security vulnerability scans on the deployed application.,To gather detailed performance metrics under simulated heavy load.,To verify the configuration stored in the Git repository.,B,"A smoke test is a quick, basic check to ensure the application starts correctly and key functionalities are available (e.g., can it serve a simple request? Is the homepage accessible?). It's not exhaustive but provides rapid feedback on whether the deployment was fundamentally successful.",Cloud Native Application Delivery,CI/CD
331,How does GitOps handle failed deployments or rollbacks compared to traditional methods?,Rollbacks require complex manual intervention on the cluster.,Failures are ignored until the next successful Git commit.,Rollbacks are typically achieved by reverting the change in Git and letting the operator synchronize the cluster to the previous known good state.,Failed deployments automatically trigger a full cluster rebuild.,Rollbacks are not possible within a GitOps framework.,C,"Because the desired state is versioned in Git, rolling back is often as simple as git revert <commit-hash>. The GitOps operator detects this change in the desired state (now pointing to the older configuration) and automatically rolls the cluster back accordingly.",Cloud Native Application Delivery,GitOps
332,What is the relationship between Continuous Integration (CI) and GitOps?,GitOps replaces the need for a CI server entirely.,"CI builds artifacts (e.g., container images); GitOps often consumes these artifacts for deployment based on Git state.",CI is responsible for deploying manifests; GitOps is responsible for building images.,They are mutually exclusive approaches to application delivery.,GitOps is a specific tool used only within CI pipelines.,B,"CI and GitOps are complementary. The CI pipeline typically handles building the application, running tests, and producing artifacts like container images (often pushing them to a registry). A commit updating a manifest in Git (e.g., with the new image tag) then triggers the GitOps workflow to deploy that artifact.",Cloud Native Application Delivery,CI/CD
333,Which cloud-native principle supports the idea of automating infrastructure provisioning alongside application deployment?,Infrastructure as Code (IaC),Manual server configuration,Stateful application design,High latency tolerance,Reactive programming,A,"IaC involves managing and provisioning infrastructure (networks, servers, load balancers, Kubernetes clusters) through machine-readable definition files (code), rather than manual configuration. This allows infrastructure changes to be versioned, tested, and automated alongside application code delivery.",Cloud Native Application Delivery,Application Delivery Fundamentals
334,"In a pull-based GitOps model, how does the operator typically authenticate to the Git repository?",Using the developer's personal Git credentials stored in a Secret.,"Using SSH keys, deploy tokens, or access tokens configured specifically for the operator.",No authentication is required if the repository is public.,Using Kubernetes ServiceAccount tokens intended for API server access.,"Authentication is handled by the CI server, not the operator.",B,"The GitOps operator needs credentials to access the Git repository. Secure methods include generating an SSH key pair and adding the public key to the repository's deploy keys, or using specific access tokens with limited scope, configured securely within the operator's deployment.",Cloud Native Application Delivery,GitOps
335,"What does a ""release candidate"" (RC) typically signify in a software release process?","The final, generally available (GA) version of the software.",An unstable nightly build intended only for internal testing.,"A version believed to be stable and potentially the final release, undergoing final testing.",A prototype version demonstrating initial concepts.,A security patch applied to a previous release.,C,"A release candidate is a build that has passed significant testing (e.g., QA, beta) and is considered potentially ready for final release. It's distributed for final verification before being declared the official stable version.",Cloud Native Application Delivery,CI/CD
336,What is a key benefit of decoupling application configuration from container images?,It simplifies the container build process by including configuration directly.,It allows the same container image to be deployed across different environments with varying configurations.,It eliminates the need for version control for configuration.,It makes container images larger and slower to pull.,It prevents the use of Kubernetes ConfigMaps and Secrets.,B,"Baking configuration into images requires rebuilding the image for every configuration change (e.g., database URL). Externalizing configuration (via ConfigMaps, Secrets, environment variables populated by the delivery system) allows the same immutable image artifact to be promoted across environments (dev, staging, prod) by applying different configurations.",Cloud Native Application Delivery,Application Delivery Fundamentals
337,How does GitOps facilitate collaboration between development and operations teams?,By requiring operations teams to manually approve every developer commit.,By providing separate Git repositories for developers and operators with no overlap.,By using a shared Git repository and pull requests as a common mechanism for proposing and reviewing infrastructure and application changes.,By eliminating the need for an operations team entirely.,By forcing developers to manage the underlying Kubernetes infrastructure.,C,"GitOps provides a common workflow centered around Git. Developers can propose application deployment changes, and operations can propose infrastructure changes via pull requests (PRs) in the same repository (or related ones). This makes changes transparent and allows for cross-functional review and collaboration.",Cloud Native Application Delivery,GitOps
338,What is the role of Helm in a GitOps workflow?,Helm replaces the Git repository as the source of truth.,Helm is the GitOps operator that reconciles the cluster state.,"Helm charts (stored in Git) can declaratively define the application, and GitOps tools deploy/manage Helm releases based on Git state.",Helm is used only for building container images within the CI pipeline.,Helm directly monitors application performance and triggers rollbacks.,C,"Helm charts provide a way to package and template Kubernetes applications. In a GitOps context, the desired state in Git might be defined using Helm charts and value files. The GitOps operator then uses Helm commands (e.g., helm template, helm install/upgrade) under the hood to render manifests and manage the application release.",Cloud Native Application Delivery,GitOps
339,"What does the ""convergence"" mean in the context of a GitOps reconciliation loop?",The process of merging multiple Git branches into one.,The act of manually applying configuration changes to the cluster.,The process where the GitOps operator brings the actual cluster state into alignment with the desired state defined in Git.,The final stage of a CI pipeline where tests are run.,The point where application performance meets SLO targets.,C,"The GitOps operator continuously compares the desired state (Git) and actual state (cluster). If they differ, it takes actions to make the actual state match the desired state. This process of driving the cluster towards the state defined in Git is called convergence.",Cloud Native Application Delivery,GitOps
340,Which Kubernetes feature allows performing updates with zero downtime by incrementally replacing old Pods with new ones?,StatefulSet update strategies.,Job completions.,Deployment rolling update strategy.,DaemonSet node affinity rules.,ResourceQuota limits.,C,"The default strategy for Kubernetes Deployments is RollingUpdate. It ensures that updates happen gradually � stopping old Pods and starting new ones incrementally � while ensuring a minimum number of Pods remain available throughout the process, thus enabling zero-downtime updates.",Cloud Native Application Delivery,CI/CD
341,"What is the ""Application Definition"" in a GitOps context?",The source code of the application written by developers.,The container image stored in a registry.,"The declarative configuration (e.g., K8s YAML, Helm Charts, Kustomize overlays) stored in Git defining the application deployment.",The documentation explaining how to use the application.,The results of the automated tests run in the CI pipeline.,C,"The Application Definition encompasses all the declarative files stored in Git that specify how the application should be configured and run in the target environment. This includes Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, Secrets (managed securely), etc.",Cloud Native Application Delivery,GitOps
342,How do feature flags complement CI/CD and progressive delivery strategies like canary releases?,Feature flags replace the need for CI/CD pipelines entirely.,Feature flags allow enabling/disabling application features at runtime without requiring a full redeployment.,Feature flags are used only for configuring infrastructure components.,Feature flags eliminate the need for version control systems.,Feature flags require manual code changes for every activation.,B,"Feature flags allow decoupling deployment from release. Code for new features can be deployed (via CI/CD) to production but remain hidden behind a flag. The feature can then be enabled for specific users (canary, A/B test) or gradually rolled out via a configuration change at runtime, without a new deployment.",Cloud Native Application Delivery,CI/CD
343,What is a key difference between kubectl apply and kubectl create? Why is apply often preferred in automated delivery pipelines?,create updates existing resources; apply only creates new ones.,apply stores configuration locally; create stores it in the cluster.,apply performs a declarative update (merging changes); create fails if the resource already exists.,create is faster for large numbers of resources.,apply requires cluster-admin privileges; create does not.,C,"kubectl apply calculates the difference between the local manifest and the live resource configuration and applies only the necessary changes. It can both create and update resources idempotently. kubectl create fails if the resource already exists, making apply much better suited for repeatable, automated CI/CD or GitOps workflows.",Cloud Native Application Delivery,Application Delivery Fundamentals
344,"If using GitOps with multiple clusters (e.g., dev, staging, prod), how might configurations be managed efficiently?","By maintaining completely separate, unrelated Git repositories for each cluster.","By using the exact same manifests for all clusters, ignoring differences.",Using tooling like Kustomize or Helm to manage base configurations and environment-specific overlays/values within a single or related Git repositories.,By manually applying changes to each cluster sequentially.,By running a different GitOps operator in each cluster with identical config.,C,"Tools like Kustomize (using overlays) or Helm (using value files) allow defining a common base configuration and layering environment-specific settings (e.g., replica counts, resource limits, domain names) on top. This promotes DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles while managing configurations across environments in Git.",Cloud Native Application Delivery,GitOps
345,What is a common trigger for a Continuous Integration pipeline?,A schedule running once per week.,A manual button click by the project manager.,"A code commit pushed to the version control repository (e.g., Git).",A new vulnerability discovered in a base image.,A successful deployment to the production environment.,C,"The most common trigger for a CI pipeline is a push event to the Git repository (e.g., pushing commits to a feature branch or merging a pull request). This ensures that every code change automatically initiates the build and test process.",Cloud Native Application Delivery,CI/CD
346,Which factor is LEAST relevant when choosing between a pull-based and push-based GitOps approach?,Security considerations regarding cluster API access.,The specific programming language used by the application being deployed.,Network policies restricting traffic flow between the CI system and the cluster.,Scalability requirements for managing many clusters.,The location of the Git repository relative to the cluster.,B,"GitOps focuses on deploying and managing applications based on manifests, regardless of the language the application itself is written in. Security, network topology, and scalability are key factors influencing the choice between pull (agent in cluster) and push (CI pushes to cluster) models.",Cloud Native Application Delivery,GitOps
347,"In a CI/CD context, what is static application security testing (SAST)?",Analyzing running application behavior for security flaws.,Scanning container images for known vulnerabilities in dependencies.,Analyzing application source code or compiled binaries for security vulnerabilities without executing the code.,Performing penetration testing against a deployed application.,Checking firewall rules protecting the application.,C,"SAST tools analyze the application's source code, bytecode, or binary code while it's ""static"" (not running) to identify potential security vulnerabilities like SQL injection flaws, buffer overflows, or insecure coding patterns. It's often integrated early in the CI pipeline.",Cloud Native Application Delivery,CI/CD
348,What is the role of idempotency in automated application delivery?,Ensuring that operations always produce different results each time they are run.,Ensuring that performing the same operation multiple times produces the same result as performing it once.,Making sure that configuration files are stored only in memory.,Requiring manual intervention for every deployment step.,Idempotency relates only to database transaction management.,B,"Idempotency is crucial for reliable automation. If a deployment script or GitOps reconciliation can be run multiple times without unintended side effects (i.e., applying the same state multiple times results in the same final state), it makes the automation safer and more resilient to transient failures or reruns. kubectl apply is designed to be idempotent.",Cloud Native Application Delivery,Application Delivery Fundamentals
349,"How can secrets (e.g., API keys, passwords) be securely injected into Pods managed via GitOps without storing plain text in Git?",By embedding secrets directly within the container image layers.,"Using tools like Sealed Secrets (encrypts secrets in Git, decrypted by a controller in-cluster) or referencing external secret managers (e.g., Vault).",Storing secrets as plain text ConfigMaps in Git.,Passing secrets as command-line arguments to the GitOps operator.,Disabling secrets management entirely for simplicity.,B,"Secure secret management in GitOps requires mechanisms to avoid plain text in Git. Common solutions involve in-cluster decryption of encrypted secrets stored in Git (Sealed Secrets, Mozilla SOPS) or using operators/injectors that fetch secrets directly from systems like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc., at deploy time.",Cloud Native Application Delivery,GitOps
350,What is a key outcome of adopting mature CI/CD practices?,Longer lead times for changes due to increased process overhead.,Reduced deployment frequency to minimize risk.,"Faster, more reliable delivery of value to end-users through automation and rapid feedback.",Increased reliance on manual testing and deployment procedures.,Complete elimination of bugs in production environments.,C,"Mature CI/CD pipelines automate the build, test, and deployment process, significantly reducing lead time (time from commit to production) and enabling more frequent, reliable releases. This allows businesses to deliver features and fixes to users faster and get feedback more quickly.",Cloud Native Application Delivery,CI/CD
